This uncleaned dataset contains a Jupyter Notebook file for getting two of the csvs - 'bus_breaks.csv' and 'ridership.csv' - from the rubus API. The dataset also includes three additional csv files: routes.csv, stops.csv, and vehicles.csv.

See the Jupyter Notebook file for further description of the dataset.

Feel free to use data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling to analyze the dataset and find interesting patterns.
